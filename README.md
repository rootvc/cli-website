## Build Notes
Run `npm run build` before serving the site locally or deploying.

That build now:
 - copies and minifies the xterm vendor assets
 - bundles the app boot/runtime code into `js/app.bundle.js`
 - emits a minified lazy-load asset for the RickRoll animation

## Performance Notes
The terminal now initializes on `DOMContentLoaded` instead of waiting for `window.onload`, and optional work such as ASCII art preloading happens after the terminal is already usable.

In local repeated Chromium benchmarks against the previous `HEAD`, median startup timings improved roughly:
 - homepage prompt visible: `1941.7ms` -> `70.1ms`
 - homepage first command rendered: `2076.5ms` -> `223.5ms`
 - `#whois-lee` deep link rendered: `1159.9ms` -> `151.9ms`
